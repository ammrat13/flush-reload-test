# Flush+Reload Test

This repository serves as my testbed for the Flush+Reload exploit. It hosts my
own implementation of it on bare-metal Linux.

I found the original paper \[1\] most helpful. It covers most of the details
required to reproduce the attack, including the assembly code they used to probe
a cache line. Of course, the processor's manual \[2\] is a good reference too.

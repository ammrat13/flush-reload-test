# Flush+Reload Test

This repository serves as my testbed for the Flush+Reload exploit. It hosts my
own implementation of it on bare-metal Linux.


## Setup

This code was tested on an AMD Ryzen 5 2600X. The spy process was run on Logical
Processor 0 and the victim was run on Logical Processor 1. Importantly, the spy
and victim ran on two different threads on the same core, allowing them to share
an (inclusive) L2 cache.

## Usage

This project has a few components to it. First is the spy program, which maps a
binary into memory then repeatedly probes at offsets into that file. The spy
program is the "main" project, and it can be built by running `nimble build
-d:release` in the root of this repository. It's important to build it in
release mode, or else the probe loop will not run fast enough. The command-line
options the program takes can be found in
`/src/flush_reload_test_pkg/config.nim`. In summary, it takes the file to probe
as the first argument, followed by any number of offsets into the file. It also
takes options for how long each timeslice should be and how many slices to
record.

A copy of the victim `gnupg` binary used can be found in the `/gnupg/`
directory. That folder also has the home directory used, as well as the script
used to build the program under GCC 12.2.0. One can use the `/run.sh` script to
spy on a signature and dump the raw data to standard out.

The raw data can be analyzed with the script `/analysis/analyze.nim`. Again, one
can check that file for the command-line options the script takes. It takes one
argument: the name of the file containing the data dumped by `/run.sh`. It also
takes options for all the thresholds used in analysis. The defaults reflect my
setup, and will likely differ on different processors. The result will be a
guess of `d_p`, from which one can factor `n`. It is highly suggested to run
this analysis multiple times and manually combine the results to clean the data.


## Results

This code is consistently able to recover `d_p` with approximately a 1% error
rate. These errors are often bit-flips, but the analysis also often mistakes two
consecutive `0`s for a `1` or vice versa.

It only works on 4096-bit RSA keys. It doesn't work for 2048-bit keys or lower.


## References

I found the original paper \[1\] most helpful. It covers most of the details
required to reproduce the attack, including the assembly code they used to probe
a cache line. Of course, the processor's manual \[2\] is a good reference too.
